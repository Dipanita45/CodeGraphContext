# C++ Sample Project

This folder contains a set of C++ files demonstrating major aspects and nuances of C++ programming, inspired by the Python sample_project. Each file is self-contained and focuses on a specific feature or idiom.

## Files

- `control_flow.cpp`: Demonstrates if/else, ternary, and for loop control flow.
- `classes.cpp`: Shows classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- `templates.cpp`: Covers function templates and specialization.
- `exceptions.cpp`: Exception handling with try/catch blocks.
- `raii_example.cpp`: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) pattern.
- `function_chains.cpp`: Function pointers, lambdas, and higher-order functions.
- `namespaces.cpp`: Use of namespaces and the `using` directive.
- `stl_usage.cpp`: STL containers and algorithms (vector, for_each, lambda).
- `file_io.cpp`: Basic file input/output using fstream.
- `edge_cases.cpp`: Edge cases such as empty files and comments only.

Each file is intended to be simple, focused, and suitable for code indexing, analysis, or as a reference for C++ language features.
